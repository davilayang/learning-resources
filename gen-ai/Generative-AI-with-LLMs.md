## Pre-training

## Prompting

- In-Context Learning
  - Setting the context in prompts to make N-shot Inferences
- Zero-shot Inference
  - E.g. in prompt, asking LLM to classify a text
- One-shot Inference
  - E.g. in prompt, give one example of text classification,
    - then asking LLM to classify another unseen one
- Few-shot Inference
  - E.g. in prompt, give two or more examples to text classification,
    - then asking LLM to classify another unseen one
  - If still incorrect inferences after five or six shots, it may not work at all
    - Consider other training techniques

## LLM Configuration

- Top K
- Top P Sampling
- Temperature

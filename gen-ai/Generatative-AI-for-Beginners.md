## LLM Possible Applications

- Text Summarisation
  - From a block of text (unstructured data) to insights
- Code Explaining
  - From a chunk of code, explain the structure...etc
- Creative Idea Generation
  - Using randomness nature, generate article, essay or assignment...etc
- Question Answering
  - Ask the agent a question and got response 
  - Search engine for specific information
- Text or Code Completion, i.e. Writing Assistance

TODO:

- Brainstorm for applications of your use case
  - Q: Problem?
  - Q: How I would use LLM?
  - Q: Impact?

## Approaches to Tailor LLM

- Prompt engineering with context
  - In the prompt to LLM, provide enough context to ensure proper response
  - The better frame the query, the more accurate response from LLM. I.e. good enough context
- Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG.
  - Store data in a vector database, then retrieve it and include in the prompt to LLM
- Fine-tuned model
  - Further train the model on data (of expected response) to ensure proper response

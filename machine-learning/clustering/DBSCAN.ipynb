    "1. Start at a random point\n",
    "2. Examine radius `ε` around the starting point\n",
    "3. If there are `min_samples` within radius `ε` of this instance (including itself),\n",
    "   - it is a core instance.\n",
    "   - all samples in this `ε`-neighborhood are part of the same cluster\n",
    "4. Repeat for each point in the cluster\n",
    "   - If a point does not have `min_samples` in its neighborhood, it is density reachable\n",
    "   - but it’s not a core instance.\n",
    "5. Repeat \n",
    "6. If there are no more points in the cluster\n",
    "   - move to another random point and begin a new cluster.\n",
    "7. Repeat.\n",
    "8. Points that don’t have any core instances in their `ε`-neighborhood are considered noise and are not assigned to a cluster.\n",

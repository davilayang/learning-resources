### Course 1

- As a new member of a data analytics team, what steps could you take to be fully informed about a current project? Who would you like to meet with?
- How would you plan an analytics project?
- What steps would you take to translate a business question to an analytical solution?
- Why is actively managing data an important part of a data analytics team's responsibilities?
- What are some considerations you might need to be mindful of when reporting results?

### Course 2

- Describe the steps you would take to clean and transform an unstructured data set.
- What specific things might you review for as part of your cleaning process?
- What are some of the outliers, anomalies, or unusual things you might consider in the data cleaning process that might impact analyses or the ability to create insights?

### Course 3

- How would you explain the difference between qualitative and quantitative data sources?
- Describe the difference between structured and unstructured data.
- Why is it important to do exploratory data analysis (EDA)?
- How would you perform EDA on a given dataset?
- How do you create or alter a visualization based on different audiences?
- How do you avoid bias and ensure accessibility in a data visualization?
- How does data visualization inform your EDA?

### Course 4

- How would you explain an A/B test to stakeholders who may not be familiar with analytics?
- If you had access to company performance data, what statistical tests might be useful to help understand performance?
- What considerations would you think about when presenting results to make sure they have an impact or have achieved the desired results?
- What are some effective ways to communicate statistical concepts/methods to a non-technical audience?
- In your own words, explain the factors that go into an experimental design for designs such as A/B tests.

### Course 5

- Describe the steps you would take to run a regression-based analysis.
- List and describe the critical assumptions of linear regression.
- What is the primary difference between R2 and adjusted R2?
- How do you interpret a Q-Q plot in a linear regression model?
- What is the bias-variance tradeoff? How does it relate to building a multiple linear regression model? Consider variable selection and adjusted R2.

### Course 6

- What kinds of business problems would be best addressed by supervised learning models?
- What requirements are needed to create effective supervised learning models?
- What does machine learning mean to you?
- How would you explain what machine learning algorithms do to a teammate who is new to the concept?
How does gradient boosting work?

1. **Plan**
   - Scope the project
   - Identify the informational needs for the squad/organisation
   - Have the widest viewpoint of a project
   - Map the path from start to completion, always have the end-product in mind
   - Take special note of tasks that may require an innovative approach within your workflow
   - NOTE:
     - Research business data
     - Define the project scope
     - Develop a workflow
     - Assess project and/or stakeholder needs
   - TODO: Questions to Ask
     - "What are the goals of the project?"
     - "What strategies will be needed?"
     - "What will be the business or operational impacts of the plan?"
2. **Analyze**
   - Acquire all of the data needed, and interact with them
   - Collect data from primary or secondary sources
   - TODO:
     - Engage with EDA, data cleaning, data processing and analysing
     - Work with stakeholders to find area for further
3. **Construct**
   - Build, interpret and revise models
   - Use ML algorithms to uncover correlations
   - Access to hidden relationships locked within data
   - TODO:
     - Select modeling approach
     - Build models
     - Build machine learning algorithms
4. **Execute**
   - Put your analysis and construction into action
   - Deliver your findings to the internal and external stakeholders
   - Stakeholders will provide feedback, ask questions, and make recommendations that you will collect and incorporate
   - TODO:
     - Share results
     - Present findings to other stakeholders
     - Address feedback

## Seniority

- Level 1:
  - "Can we do this?"
  - You give them a problem (and maybe some guidance) and see whether they can solve it.
- Level 2:
  - "How do we do this well?"
  - Thinking the long-term implications
  - "Should we do this?"
  - "What should we do?" and "What shouldn't we do?"
- Level 3: 
  - Ability to navigate ambiguity
  - Ability to bring clarity.
  - It’s the realisation that the world is not black and white and that ideological thinking is limiting.
  - "When a person who can navigate ambiguity is asked, “should we do this?” their answer is not “yes” or “no.” It’s “it depends.”

    "   - Probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it's True, (False Positive)\n",

    "   - Probability of observing results \"as or more\" extreme than those observed\n",
    "     - Given the Null hypothesis is True\n",

You can review the [statsmodels documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm.html) to learn more, as well as to [this article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/03/anova-%e2%80%93-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/) and [this explanation on StackExchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/20452/how-to-interpret-type-i-type-ii-and-type-iii-anova-and-manova).
